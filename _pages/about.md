## About Me
I am a statistician and mathematician specializing in applied methods for the humanities and social sciences.
My interests and experiences span fields such as linguistics, education, library science, and public policy.
As a statistician, I primarily concern myself with stochastic processes and machine learning techniques.
Within mathematics, I have experience in modeling with systems of differential equations, borrowing extensively from the biomathematical canon.
