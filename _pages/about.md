Hi!
My name is Jonah, I'm a graduate student at the [University of Kentucky](https://uky/edu).
I study statistics in the [Dr. Bing Zhang Department of Statistics](https://stat.as.uky.edu/).

Work and Research
======
My work focuses on any of the intersections between mathematics, ecology, food, and language.
I am a mathematical modeler, specializing in both differential equations and recurrent processes in biology and food science.
My current interests tend more towards phylogenetics, graphs, and algebraic statistics.
Many of my research interests in food science come from first-hand experience working with pastry and bread during my undergraduate studies.

Background and History
======
I am set to receive my MS from the University of Kentucky in May 2025.
I previously received a BS in [Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.math.fsu.edu/) from the [Florida State University](https://fsu.edu) in 2023.
While at Florida State, I completed an honors undergraduate thesis under the direction of [Dr. Nick Cogan](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~cogan/).

Miscellaneous
------
In my free time I bake a lot of bread, edit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jonahksmith), and self-study languages.
I am also a musician; I sing in the [Lexington Singers](https://www.lexsing.org/#/) (as a low bass) and have played the tuba for over 10 years.
I am incredibly interested in Slavic linguistics, and speak a decent amount of both Ukrainian and Russian.
In addition, I can speak Spanish with working proficiency.
Many of my future research projects are influenced by the intersections of these fields.

I am currently...
