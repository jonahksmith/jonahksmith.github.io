Hi!
My name is Jonah, I'm a graduate student at the [University of Kentucky](https://uky/edu).
I study statistics in the [Dr. Bing Zhang Department of Statistics](https://stat.as.uky.edu/).

Work and Research
======
My work focuses on any of the intersections between mathematics, ecology, food, and language.
I am a trained mathematical modeler, specializing in both differential equations and recurrent processes in biology and food science.
Many of my research interests in food science come from first-hand experience working with pastry and bread during my undergraduate studies.

Background and History
======
I am set to receive my MS from the University of Kentucky in May 2025.
I previously received a BS in [Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.math.fsu.edu/) from the [Florida State University](https://fsu.edu) in 2023.
While at Florida State, I completed an honors undergraduate thesis under the direction of [Dr. Nick Cogan](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~cogan/).

Miscellaneous
------
In my free time I bake a lot of bread, edit [Wikipedia]i(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jonahksmith), and self-study languages.
I am incredibly interested in Slavic linguistics, and speak a decent amount of both Ukrainian and Russian.
Many of my future research projects are influenced by the intersections of these fields.
