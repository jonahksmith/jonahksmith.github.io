title: "Undergraduate Thesis"
excerpt: "Sourdough fermentation is a complex biochemical process governed by interactions at the micro-
scopic scale between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts. The most commonly encountered
species of each of these organisms, Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis (formerly Lactobacillus san-
franciscensis) and Kazachstania humilis (formerly Candida milleri) exhibit several characteristics
of symbiosis that give sourdough starters their leavening power. We seek to model the interac-
tions between these two forces as they consume, produce, and partition different resources found
in wheat flour. Using a combination of Gompertz and Michaelis-Menten models for population
kinetics, we create a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations to map the continuous
growth of sourdough between starter refreshment and a discrete process by which we can simulate
back-slopping. The combined model accurately captures many qualities of sourdough fermentation
and enables further research and optimization of the model."
