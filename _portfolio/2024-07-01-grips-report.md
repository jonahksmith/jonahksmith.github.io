title: "GRIPS EnergyLab Report"
excerpt: "Wind energy is one of the major sources of potential future sustainable energy
across the world. The usual method for absorbing energy from the wind is con-
verting the energy of wind into rotational energy using a wind turbine. This
process creates a wake behind the turbine, as air gets some of its energy ab-
sorbed, it slows down immediately behind the turbine. Our goal for this project
is to create a simulation using the Finite Element Method to simulate two tur-
bines, and generate as much data as possible to look at the wake effect of two
turbines situated behind each other to understand what variables in a simula-
tion have the largest impact on energy output"
