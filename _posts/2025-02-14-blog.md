This is the first of what might end up being many posts on this page.
It also might not be followed by any other posts in the future.
Who knows?

What I want from this
======
Ideally, this website will serve as a sort of living CV for anything I build.
I have no idea how diligently I will maintain this site, but I've put enough work into setting it up that it should be roughly pain free to add new articles, portfolio elements, whatever in the future.

What I don't want from this
======
I'm not really a ``blog" person, so I don't anticipate this being a blog in the usual sense of people who blog.
Maybe I'll write about an `R` package if I write one, maybe I'll write about a bread recipe I've tried, who knows.
At the end of the day this is likely to just be a small piece of a creative outlet.

Test
------
Aaaand this is a test of the subheading capability.
